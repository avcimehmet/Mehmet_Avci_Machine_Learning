# Predicting Car Prices With Machine Learning Algorithms

# Introduction

In this machine learning project, I aimed to ***predict car prices*** in the market based on various features and characteristics of the cars. The project follows a **typical machine learning pipeline**, including ***data loading, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, model evaluation, and comparison of different models***. My outputs will be based on a regression model. Initially, I will implement a linear regression model, I will also implement a secondary model ***Random Forest Regressor*** for model comparison. I will select a ***champion model*** between these two models. At the end of the project, I will provide a ***comprehensive report*** summarizing the entire study.

## Preparation and Exploration of the Data

The dataset used in this project relies on the data from a kaggle resource. It includes a variety of features related to 65 different car models.
